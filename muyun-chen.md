## Game Design
### Objective
* You lose your way and get a magic compass to help you.
* Swipe correctly means you are on the right way, try to swipe quickly and earn high scores.

### Gameplay Mechanics
* There are 2 concentric compasses. One white one black, both with random rotation.
* There's an arrow at the center of the overlaid compasses, white or black (random)
* The arrow's color tells which compass shows your real geomagnetic field. For example, if the arrow is black, it means the black compass shows your  real geomagnetic field, and the other compass show the direction you need to go. if the black arrow points to W on the white compass, it means you need to go W in your real geomagnetic field, so  swipe toward W on black compass. If the arrow is white, vise verser.
